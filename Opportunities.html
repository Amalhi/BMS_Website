        <div class="row">
          <div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>Yell Coach: YELL (Youth Engage Learn Lead), is about gaining leadership skills in a hands-on sports context.  You will receive training and certifications, but much of the learning will happen through your volunteer work in the Burnaby MoreSports program.  Volunteers are a huge part of our program – we simply couldn’t do it without the positive energy and commitment of the YELL coaches.
<br>
All YELL participants receive training and certifications, free of charge.  Through your training and volunteer experience you will learn to work with children, lead recreational sport programs, and practice other valuable skills in a safe and supported environment.  The YELL Leadership Program can also help you gain valuable work experience for resumes, meet graduation requirements, and receive reference letters.  We hope you will even have some fun in the process!

          <div class="large-12 columns">
            <p>Junior Coach: The Junior coach program is designed to get Grade 6 and 7 students involved. Typically these kids have participated in Burnaby MoreSports programs and want to continue to be involved. As Junior Coaches, they get to help run the program they previously participated in. While the program is not as formal as the YELL coach program, Junior Coaches will get experience coaching kids in a supportive environment.
